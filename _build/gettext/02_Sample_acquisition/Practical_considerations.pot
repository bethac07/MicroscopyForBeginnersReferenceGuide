msgid "Magnification and resolution: the higher the numerical aperture (NA) of the lens, the finer the resolution one can obtain in one's sample. The NA is calculated as {math}`NA=RI * sin(θ)`, relating both to the {term}`refractive index` of the sample, glass, and {term}`immersion media` as well as the range of angles of emitted light that can be collected into the lens. Unless special techniques are used, the typical limit of resultion is calculated as {math}`d = λ / 2NA`, meaning the resolution is set both by the NA of the lens but also by the wavelength of light used for imaging."

msgid "Color correction: When performing multicolor microscopy, it is important to choose an objective lens that is labeled as `Apo` or `Super Apo`, as such lenses are corrected to focus 3 to 6 colors in the same plane at the same time. `Fluor` lenses will typically focus two colors at once."

msgid "Working distance: The working distance (WD) gives the distance in millimeters that the lens can focus into the sample. This distance includes the coverslip and mounting media as well. If imaging a thick sample, and/or if needing to image away from the surface of the sample, it is important to ensure the lens has a sufficient working distance."

msgid "The amount of signal captured from any fluorophore will be related not just to the intrinsic brightness of the fluorophore, but also the amount of excitation light it is exposed to (due to duration, power, or both) as well as amount of time and signal multiplication that happens at the detector (typically a camera or a photomultiplier tube (PMT)). An optimal experiment is typically one that minimizes the amount of light hitting the sample (to reduce photobleaching and/or phototoxicity) while acheiving adequate fluorescent signal and in minimal time on the equipment. How exactly to balance these competing factors will depend on the exact biology being studied and the researcher's constraints."
