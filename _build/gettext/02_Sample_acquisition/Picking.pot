The image below (from [Fundamentals of Microscopy by Jermey Sanderson](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cpmo.76) {cite}`Sanderson2020-qz`) gives a sense of the sorts of decisions one should consider when choosing a microscope; a more thorough description of the pros and cons of various kinds of microscopes can be found in [this tutorial](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-020-0313-9){cite}`Jonkman2020-bo`."
