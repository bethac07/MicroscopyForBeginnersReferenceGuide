msgid "After segmenting an image to locate the pixels belonging to different objects, morphology can be measured readily in many image analysis softwares, like FIJI and CellProfiler. For example, in {term}`Fiji`, after identifying your objects as {term}`ROIs`, be sure to **Analyze > Set Measurements‚Ä¶** and select ‚ÄúShape Descriptors‚Äù then simply measure your {term}`ROIs` with **Analyze > Measure**. In CellProfiler, this is accomplished using the module MeasureObjectSizeShape."

msgid "**Failing to use calibrated units**. Be sure to properly calibrate your images and present final measurements in microns (or similar units). If measuring 3D images, be sure to take into account the z-step, which is likely larger than the xy pixel size."
