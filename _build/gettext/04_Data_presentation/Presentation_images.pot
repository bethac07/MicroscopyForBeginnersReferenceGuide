msgid "Microscopy images are often shown in scientific papers to illustrate a particular conclusion. While qualitative conclusions are not a subsitute for quantitative comparisons (see next section), images can certainly guide our reasoning and our conclusions. Following a few consistent best practices ensures that these conclusions are correct and robust."
