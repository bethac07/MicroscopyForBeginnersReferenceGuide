msgid "When presenting microscopy image data in biology and biomedicine, it's important to consider the quality of the images, the labeling and annotation of important features, and the overall visual appeal. This also applies to diagrams and plots which convey numerical data derived from microscopy images. Chart types must in addition be suitable for the specific data that is being conveyed to not mislead audiences. This applies to image data in scientific posters, talk-slides, or publications."
