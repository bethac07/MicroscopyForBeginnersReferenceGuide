"When presenting microscopy image data in biology and biomedicine, it's "
"important to consider the quality of the images, the labeling and "
"annotation of important features, and the overall visual appeal. This "
"also applies to diagrams and plots which convey numerical data derived "
"from microscopy images. Chart types must in addition be suitable for the "
"specific data that is being conveyed to not mislead audiences. This "
"applies to image data in scientific posters, talk-slides, or "
"publications."
