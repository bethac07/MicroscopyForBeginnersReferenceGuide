"There are many different options for types of samples to image, and "
"advances in sample preparation techniques and imaging modalities are "
"continually enabling the imaging of more diverse and complex biological "
"specimens. As with many other aspects of experimental design, sample type"
" selection comes with tradeoffs. Samples that are amenable to simple "
"preparation and imaging tend to be small, thin, and relatively clear, "
"like a monolayer of cultured cells. Such samples have obvious advantages "
"and can be imaged in a high-throughput manner, but they're not suitable "
"for every biological question. Sometimes a thicker specimen, like an "
"organoid, or whole or sectioned tissue is needed, especially when the "
"biological question involves interactions between different types of "
"cells. Carefully consider what biological context is appropriate for your"
" question and what measurements you'd ultimately like to be able to make."

"Most applications in microscopy require imaging through a glass coverslip"
" of a specific thickness and tolerance. However, many cell types do not "
"survive or cannot grow on glass and require additional coatings and "
"manipulations of the coverslip to ensure the health of the sample. As an "
"alternative some companies manufacture imaging chambers (multi well "
"plates, 35 mm dishes‚Ä¶) with proprietary polymers that have similar "
"properties to glass (optical polymers), thus enabling high resolution "
"imaging. It is imperative to understand whether the immersion oil used "
"during imaging affects the integrity of these polymers, as the solvents "
"in some immersion media can crack or dissolve the polymer layer."

"**Photobleaching and phototoxicity** - Photobleaching can be defined as "
"the irreversible destruction of a fluorophore in its excited state, "
"meaning, that fluorophore will not be able to emit more light and the "
"fluorescence signal will therefore degrade over time, affecting signal to"
" noise ratio and intensity measurements. In order to minimize "
"photobleaching during acquisition, there are a number of photobleaching "
"reagent agents that can be added to the media. These agents minimize "
"photobleaching of fluorophores to a different extent, and therefore it is"
" important to contact the manufacturer to ensure they are optimal for the"
" specific fluorophore. For example addition of oxygen scavengers to the "
"imaging media such as glucose oxidase or pyranose 2-oxidase can "
"significantly reduce photobleaching. It is important to understand that "
"the use of {term}`oxygen scavengers` may affect live cell imaging, as "
"these scavengers can affect the ATP and oxygen levels within the sample, "
"compromising its health and therefore biological function."

"**Cells are dying** - Fluorescent light induces DNA damage and oxidation "
"of cellular components (phototoxicity). In addition, fluorophore "
"photobleaching can further induce phototoxicity by creating reactive "
"oxygen species (ROS). The addition of antioxidants and removal of certain"
" molecules (e.g., riboflavin) from the imaging media can reduce the ROS "
"produced during imaging, improving the health of the "
"sample.{cite}`Stockley2017`"

"**My fixed cells don't looked as expected** - Fixation can change the "
"localization and fluorescence of different proteins. Where possible, "
"always compare the distribution of a protein or molecule of interest with"
" and without fixation. Also consider whether a different {term}`fixation`"
" method may be more appropriate for your specimen."

msgid ""
"**My sample is too opaque** - Thicker specimens, like thick tissue "
"sections, pigmented cells, or whole organisms can be challenging to image"
" due to light absorption and scattering induced by the inhomogeneities in"
" {term}`refractive index` within the tissue itself, resulting in poor "
"light penetration. To facilitate imaging of tissues, researchers often "
"cut thick tissues into slices of different thicknesses. This process is "
"called tissue sectioning. In most cases the samples are fixed and "
"embedded in paraffin or frozen in tissue freezing medium and later cut "
"into thin slices by a machine like a cryostat, microtome, or vibratome "
"and sections collected into a tube or onto a slide. Alternatively, most "
"components in any complex biological system such as an organ are not "
"contained within this two-dimensional volume, and therefore, this "
"approach compromises the understanding of the spatial relationships among"
" cellular components. Tissue clearing focused on reducing the "
"inhomogeneities in the tissue by equilibrating the {term}`refractive "
"index` throughout the sample. This allows light to pass through the "
"tissue and therefore enables high resolution, volumetric imaging of whole"
" organs and tissues using conventional microscopy techniques such as "
"confocal microscopy without the need to physically section the sample."
