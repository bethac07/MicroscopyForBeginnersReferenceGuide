"A good image starts at the bench. The best performing instrument will not"
" produce rigorous, reproducible or high quality data unless sample "
"preparation has been optimized. To design a rigorous and reproducible "
"microscopy experiment, it is critical to identify the goal of the "
"experiment and understand the factors that impact the image. This "
"information informs researchers about how to prepare the sample, what "
"minimal controls and corrections are needed, how to choose the "
"appropriate instrumentation, optimize acquisition, analyze and present "
"microscopy data."

"Here we will discuss some of the key choices you will make during sample "
"preparation, including selecting your sample type and fluorophore (if "
"you're performing fluorescence microscopy). We also discuss some minimal "
"controls necessary for interpreting your results."
