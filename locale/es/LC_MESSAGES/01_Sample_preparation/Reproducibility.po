"While in a perfect world, antibodies would always be specific to a "
"particular target, unfortunately, this cannot always be relied upon when "
"performing {term}`immunolabeling`. {cite}`Uhlen2016-wy` When possible, "
"one should perform knockout and/or knockdown controls to confirm antibody"
" specificity; where not, look for availability of another antibody to a "
"different part of the target molecule (sometimes called the _epitope_) "
"and confirm you get consistent localization."

"Optimizing your {term}`blocking` and {term}`permeabilization` conditions "
"for the particular antibody and protocol can reduce non-specific "
"background. No-primary-antibody controls should always be performed as "

"Expression of fluorescently-tagged proteins can make localization of a "
"molecule or structure possible, especially when no good antibody exist "
"for immunolabeling and/or it will be helpful to observe the molecule's "
"behavior in live cells. While a study comparing overlap between the same "
"molecular targets with fluorescent proteins vs antibodies found 80% "
"overlap, they also found that some considerations (such as whether the C-"
" or N- terminus of a protein is tagged) may cause changes in "
"localization. {cite}`Stadler2013`. A recent paper {cite}`Sittewelle2023` "
"surveys considerations for genetic tagging of molecules for live "
"microscopy."

"When performing multicolor fluorescence microscopy, it is critical to "
"choose fluorophores with sufficiently distinct excitation and emission "
"spectra; online tools such as FPbase {cite}`Lambert2019-xl` can help with"
" such selections, especially if you know the various optical components "
"of the microscope on which you will be imaging your samples (these "
"configurations can be saved and shared on FPbase; ask the maintainer of "
"the microscope you plan to use if such a configuration file is already "
"online). Even if you believe your fluorophores are sufficiently "
"separated, it is critical to check single-color fluorescent controls "
"using the same imaging conditions (and preferably on the same day) as "
"your multicolor controls to be certain no bleedthrough is occurring; it "
"is _mandatory_ to do this if you are planning to measure "
"[colocalization](content/colocalization)."
