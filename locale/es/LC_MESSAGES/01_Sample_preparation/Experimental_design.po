msgid ""
"Many imaging applications involve mounting on glass coverslips, either "
"directly or using a coverslip mounted into a dish. While there are a wide"
" range of coverslip sizes and shapes, the most important specification to"
" take into account is the coverslip thickness (0.17 mm) or grade (#1.5 "
"grade) and tolerance (how precise the thickness measurement is. For "
"example, the thickness of a #1.5 coverslip can vary between 0.17-0.19mm, "
"whereas a #1.5H has a standard deviation of 0.005 mm). These factors are "
"important because most microscope manufacturers assume a specific "
"coverslip thickness in the design of objective lenses to minimize common "
"occurring aberrations. These aberrations tend to affect the brightness "
"and axial resolution, reducing signal to noise ratio, sharpness and "
"resolution . The tolerance of the coverslip (to minimize the variability "
"in thickness) is essential for super-resolution techniques or intensity "
"measurements in images collected with high numerical aperture objectives."
" Other applications do not require the mounting of samples onto glass or "
"plastic, but instead have the sample and the objective lens immersed in "
"the same medium."

"The {term}`refractive index` the sample is placed in, as well as the "
"refractive index of the glass and the medium between the objective and "
"the sample are all critical to determining the overall resolution that "
"can be achieved. The {term}`mounting media` can have other important "
"optical and/or experimental properties; it is important to use the "
"correct mounting media for experiment planned."

"Fluorophores are molecules that are able to emit light upon absorption of"
" a photon, typically of shorter wavelength. The fluorophores relevant to "
"biomedical research can be small molecules organic dyes (FITC, Alexa "
"Fluor 488) that bind specific cell structure (e.g., DAPI, BODIPY, "
"mitotrackers), fluorescent analogues of small molecules (e.g., "
"phalloidin, fluorescent amino acids) or fluorescent proteins. Some of the"

"Understanding what fluorophores are available, their properties and the "
