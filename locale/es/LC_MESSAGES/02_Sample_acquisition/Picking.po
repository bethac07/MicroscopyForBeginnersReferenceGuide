"Choosing the right microscope for your experiment will be a factor both "
"of what the experiment dictates and what the researcher can access. The "
"image below (from [Fundamentals of Microscopy by Jermey "
"Sanderson](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cpmo.76) {cite}`Sanderson2020-qz`) "
"gives a sense of the sorts of decisions one should consider when choosing"
" a microscope; a more thorough description of the pros and cons of "
"various kinds of microscopes can be found in [this "
"tutorial](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-020-0313-9){cite}`Jonkman2020-bo`."
