"Magnification and resolution: the higher the numerical aperture (NA) of "
"the lens, the finer the resolution one can obtain in one's sample. The NA"
" is calculated as {math}`NA=RI * sin(θ)`, relating both to the "
"{term}`refractive index` of the sample, glass, and {term}`immersion "
"media` as well as the range of angles of emitted light that can be "
"collected into the lens. Unless special techniques are used, the typical "
"limit of resultion is calculated as {math}`d = λ / 2NA`, meaning the "
"resolution is set both by the NA of the lens but also by the wavelength "
"of light used for imaging."

"Color correction: When performing multicolor microscopy, it is important "
"to choose an objective lens that is labeled as `Apo` or `Super Apo`, as "
"such lenses are corrected to focus 3 to 6 colors in the same plane at the"
" same time. `Fluor` lenses will typically focus two colors at once."

"Working distance: The working distance (WD) gives the distance in "
"millimeters that the lens can focus into the sample. This distance "
"includes the coverslip and mounting media as well. If imaging a thick "
"sample, and/or if needing to image away from the surface of the sample, "
"it is important to ensure the lens has a sufficient working distance."

"The amount of signal captured from any fluorophore will be related not "
"just to the intrinsic brightness of the fluorophore, but also the amount "
"of excitation light it is exposed to (due to duration, power, or both) as"
" well as amount of time and signal multiplication that happens at the "
"detector (typically a camera or a photomultiplier tube (PMT)). An optimal"
" experiment is typically one that minimizes the amount of light hitting "
"the sample (to reduce photobleaching and/or phototoxicity) while "
"acheiving adequate fluorescent signal and in minimal time on the "
"equipment. How exactly to balance these competing factors will depend on "
"the exact biology being studied and the researcher's constraints."
