"Microscopes are optical instruments, and as such, they are composed of "
"different optical components and devices. As a beginner, it is important "
"to recognize the experimental parameters that can affect the quality and "
"rigor of the imaging data, and by extension, its interpretation."

"A foundational concept is the “light path,” which can be used to trace "
"out light’s trajectory from the light source to the detector. When "
"working with microscopes, whether it is a cell culture microscope or a "
"cutting-edge superresolution system, it is important to take the time to "
"trace out the different light paths in the system. By approaching the "
"system as a sum of its parts means that optimizing and troubleshooting "
"become systematic processes compared to when the system is treated as a "
"black box. This [interactive tutorial at "
"MicroscopyU](https://www.microscopyu.com/tutorials/tepaths) shows the "
"light paths in a standard inverted microscope; [this "
"view](https://www.microscopyu.com/microscopy-basics/components) gives "
"more detail about the various parts."

"While far from a comprehensive list of what is available, a few of the "
"most common types of microscopes are listed below."

"**Widefield**, sometimes called _epifluorescence_, microscopes that take "
"in all the light available to them in a single light path; this approach "
"requires the least complex hardware, and also is often advantageous when "
"imaging dim samples. {term}`Deconvolution` is sometimes performed after "
"imaging on a widefield microscope to remove blur."

"**Confocal** - microscopes that remove out-of-focus light in the light "
"path, typically using one or many pinholes to physically block this "
"light. Several variants of confocal microscopy exist; spinning-disk "
"confocal microscopes are often preferred for live-cell imaging "
"applications as they tend to minimize toxicity to the sample."

"**Multiphoton** microscopes utilize multiple pulses of longer-wavelength "
"(lower energy) light to penetrate deep into tissue, since tissues are "
"less likely to scatter these wavelengths; once there, multiple low-"
"engergy photons hitting the fluorphore at the same time will use their "
"combined energy to activate a fluorophore that each photon alone would be"
" too weak to do. Because the benefit of these systems is in their deeper "
"penetration, they are often used for performing live-animal imaging."

msgid ""
"**Superresolution** microscopes that are designed to allows the user to "
"bypass the minimum optical resolution limit (typically 200 nm, depending "
"on sample consideration) to resolve very small structures. Sometimes this"
" is achieved with specialized hardware (such as in STED and STORM) and "
"sometimes with specialized probes (such as in PALM and STORM)."

msgid ""
"**Light sheet** microscopes that illuminate the sample perpendicular to "
"the axis of imaging, often by a second, orthogonal set of objective "
"lenses. This allows for thin optical sectioning across large volumes, but"
" introduces more considerations around sample mounting. Many variations "
"on light sheet microscopes have emerged in recent years."

"No matter which kind of microscope you use, scientific microscopes are "
"complex instruments with many working parts, all of which typically must "
"be in good working order and calibrated/aligned properly for quantitative"
" imaging to take place. The maintainer of your microscope will typically "
"ensure this, but speak with them regularly about questions you may have "
"and about how changes to the microscope configuration may affect your "
"ability to accurately make certain measurements. Your microscope "
"maintainer may be maintaining a large number of microscopes with a large "
"number of independent users, so if something looks \"off\", make sure to "
"talk with them before proceeding!"
