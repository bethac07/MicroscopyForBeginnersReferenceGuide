"Let's say you've opened your image in {term}`Fiji` and you want to "
"process it in some way (e.g., maximum intensity projection, splitting "
"channels, etc.) before saving it out to measure somewhere else. You go to"
" `Image` > `Type` > `RGB (Color)` since you want a color image to import "
"into your next analysis software and then save the resulting image. "
"What's the problem with this? By making this change, even if the image "
"looks exactly the same to your eyes, you've actually inadvertently "
"changed the intensity values quite a bit! Let's take a look at an "
"example. In Fiji there are several built-in example images. Let's open "
"neuron.tif (you can follow along by going to `File` > `Open Samples...` >"
" `Neuron (5 channels)`."
