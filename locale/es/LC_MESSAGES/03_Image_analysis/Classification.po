msgid "What is classification?"
msgstr ""

"Simply put, phenotypic classification is about categorizing objects into "
"different groups based on their features (aka measurements)."
msgstr ""

msgid "üìè How do I measure it?"

"Phenotypic classification can be performed a few different ways. One way "
"to break this down is by unsupervised vs. supervised classification."
msgstr ""

#: ../../03_Image_analysis/Classification.md:12
msgid ""
"In **supervised classification**, a human also provides information on "
"what the different groups of objects should look like by providing "
"representative examples of each group in a training dataset. The computer"
" then learns how to assign objects to groups based on their measurements "
"by testing models against the ground truth training dataset."
msgstr ""

#: ../../03_Image_analysis/Classification.md:14
msgid ""
"For example, you could classify cells based on a visual phenotype and "
"train a machine learning classifier to derive which measurement ranges "
"are associated with different classes. This is supervised classification "
"because a person is providing instruction of how many classes there "
"should be and examples of what each class should look like for the "
"computer to learn from. An example of this could be annotating a subset "
"of cells that are in different stages of mitosis and training a "
"classifier to use your labels to find other cells in those stages."

msgid ""
"In **unsupervised classification**, you group objects based on their "
"measurements, but without any top-down human-defined guidance into how "
"many groups there are or what the groups should look like."
msgstr ""

#: ../../03_Image_analysis/Classification.md:18
msgid ""
"For example, you could measure hundreds or thousands of features of cells"
" from many treatments, as is typical in large-scale cell profiling "
"experiments. Next you could let the computer cluster the cells into some "
"number of different groups based on having similar measurements. This is "
"a form of unsupervised clustering, where you observe what groups emerge "
"from a computer considering their measurements only, and not class labels"
" we impose as researchers. These sorts of clustering experiments can "
"provide novel results but may also be harder to interpret; see this "
"protocol{cite}`GarciaFossaCruz2023` for more information."

"**Valid measurements are still important** Classification can be simple "
"or complex, but results always depend on the validity of your "
"measurements. For this reason, all the caveats of earlier measurement "
"sections also apply here."

"**Machines are lazy** Machine learning classifiers aren‚Äôt necessarily "
"going to learn the biologically relevant features that distinguish "
"objects from distinct groups. Confounding features, or features that vary"
" with your phenotype but are not biologically related to it, can limit "
"the usefulness of your classifier and lead to incorrect conclusions. For "
"instance, if clinicians often put rulers next to malignant looking moles "
"and not next to benign moles and try to train a machine learning "
"classifier to distinguish malignant vs. benign, the model might learn to "
"classify images with rulers as malignant without tapping into any of the "
"relevant features of the moles. This is a [real "
"example](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30244720/) {cite}`Narla2018-qh`."
" If possible, examining which features your model is relying on to "
"classify objects can be a way to check for this. It‚Äôs also important to "
"standardize how you capture images of your different classes of objects "
"and include a large enough training set with images with lots of "
"variation. You wouldn‚Äôt want all your positive cells to come from samples"
" you imaged in March and all your negative cells from samples you imaged "
"in January, for example."

"**Violating model assumptions** If using a machine learning classifier, "
"different models come with different baked-in assumptions. If you‚Äôre "
"starting out, it can be difficult to know which to pick. There are "
"interactive tools such as [CellProfiler "
"Analyst](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/20/3210/2196630)"
" {cite}`Stirling2021-ov` and [Piximi](https://www.piximi.app/) that make "
"training a classifier easier, especially if you don‚Äôt know how to code."

"**Messy boundaries** Most methods of supervised classification, where the"
" user assigns objects to a score or to a bin, ultimately treat each bin "
"as a totally separate entity; biology is rarely so neat. For example, a "
"supervised classifier for cell cycle phase must assign a cell to one "
"phase, but in fact progression through the cell cycle is not a perfectly "
"switch-like process, as can be visualized by measurements of individual "
"cells (colored by their class given by a human observer). More "
"sophisticated methods may be needed to classify more continuous "
"phenotypes"
