"In this section,  we detail information and tips about some common, very "
"useful types of image analysis. We first describe two aspects of "
"morphological analysis. **Morphology** is the study of the appearance, "
"form, and structure of an object and morphological measurements include "
"those based on object **shape** (e.g. cell area) as well as **intensity**"
" (e.g. mean brightness of GFP). After describing shape-based and "
"intensity-based analyses, we also present tips for measuring "
"**colocalization**, **tracking objects**, and **classifying objects**."
