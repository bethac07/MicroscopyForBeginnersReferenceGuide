"Both journals and scientific funders have placed more emphasis in recent "
"years on the fact that it is critical to save both the raw data generated"
" during the course of scientific discovery as well as the workflows used "
"to process such data. While mandates to publicly deposit raw image data "
"have recently gone into place in several countries, it can be difficult "
"for researchers to know where to store images, code, and metadata "
"associated with their bioimaging experiments."

"There are many options for storing image data in online repositories. "
"These services make it easy to share and reuse data. The best option will"
" depend on the size of the dataset, the budget for storage, whether there"
" is related non-image data, and how much metadata is available for the "
"dataset. Some options are summarized below:"

"**Not storing original versions of images**. It is critical that the raw "
"image data be saved and stored. It is very important that these files are"
" not compressed formats (e.g., '.jpeg') or modified from the original "
"files on which analysis was performed. If files are modified, "
"measurements will change and the analysis pipeline will not be "
"reproducible to anyone else."

"**Necessary imaging metadata is unavailable**. In order to properly "
"calibrate measurement data, it's critical that information like pixel "
"size (e.g., in microns), the microscope manufacturer and model, and "
"acquisition settings are included alongside the data. If this isn't "
"included, it will be very difficult to reproduce results or use the "
"combine the data with other datasets."
