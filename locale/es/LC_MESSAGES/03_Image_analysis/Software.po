"When it comes time to select a software program for your image analysis, "
"there are many options, some more general and others highly specialized "
"to specific image modalities or types of experiments. In general, a good "
"place to start exploring is by examining papers in your field and seeing "
"what others have used to analyze similar experiments to your own. It’s "
"important to note that there isn’t one correct answer to \"Which program "
"should I use?\" Depending on your biological question, your images, and "
"your own comfort with coding, there are many options available."
