"After segmenting an image to locate the pixels belonging to different "
"objects, morphology can be measured readily in many image analysis "
"softwares, like FIJI and CellProfiler. For example, in {term}`Fiji`, "
"after identifying your objects as {term}`ROIs`, be sure to **Analyze > "
"Set Measurements…** and select “Shape Descriptors” then simply measure "
"your {term}`ROIs` with **Analyze > Measure**. In CellProfiler, this is "
"accomplished using the module MeasureObjectSizeShape."

"**Not understanding the limitations of your images**. All biological "
"structures are 3D, but we often analyze 2D images. Often this is still "
"very useful! But the larger and more complex your objects (e.g., neurons "
"in a tissue section), the more limited a 2D view becomes."

"**Failing to use calibrated units**. Be sure to properly calibrate your "
"images and present final measurements in microns (or similar units). If "
"measuring 3D images, be sure to take into account the z-step, which is "
"likely larger than the xy pixel size."
