"Intensity refers to the brightness of signal for a fluorescent label. "
"Using intensity measurements, we can infer a relative amount of "
"fluorophore or stain. So for instance, if you have a protein tagged with "
"a fluorophore, you can measure the intensity of that fluorophore to get a"
" relative measure of how much protein is present in your sample. "
"Intensity measurements include the following (non-exhaustive) and can be "
"measured within an image, in a object like a cell, in subregions of an "
"object:"

"Intensity is relatively straightforward to measure, but can be quite "
"tricky to do _correctly_ (see below). We strongly suggest you contact an "
"image analysis expert before proceeding with this type of analysis "
"because there are so many places things can go wrong. In general, you "
"want to measure on either raw images, or illumination-corrected images, "
"but in general with minimal {term}`image processing`. Illumination-"
"correction is a form of {term}`image processing` to compensate for the "
"uneven pattern of illumination produced by most light sources where the "
"middle of the field of illumination is brighter than the edges. Then "
"intensity measurements can be made in any standard image analysis "
"software, either across the whole image or in identified objects. See "
"below for an example workflow:"

"To understand saturation another way, imagine you‚Äôre trying to measure "
"average male height with a 2 meter tape measure. If our sample contains "
"men that are taller than 2 meters, we can‚Äôt tell _how much taller_ than 6"
" feet they are; they‚Äôre like saturated pixels that exceed the intensity "
"we can detect. This saturation of our measurement tool means we can‚Äôt "
"accurately report average height."

"**Saturation** Saturated pixels are so bright their intensity values max "
"out our detector (camera). If you have saturated pixels in the cells "
"you‚Äôre trying to measure, you really can‚Äôt do most intensity "
"measurements. This is because for saturated pixels, you don‚Äôt know how "
"bright they really are, just that they‚Äôre brighter than you can detect. "
"There are some intensity measurements that are robust to some saturation."
" For example, the median intensity of an image won‚Äôt be affected by "
"saturation unless you have >¬Ω the image saturated. But measurements like "
"mean intensity will be affected by saturation."

"**Inadequate controls** In most cases, the exact intensity measures you "
"get don‚Äôt mean anything biologically in isolation. It‚Äôs only by "
"comparison of conditions that we can generate some biological insight. A "
"control condition is therefore **very** important to compare to your "
"experimental condition."

"**Not matching imaging conditions across experimental conditions** "
"Because intensity measures are affected by exposure time, light source "
"intensity, and other factors, it‚Äôs very important to match imaging "
"settings across your samples. Relatedly, you should make sure you don‚Äôt "
"separate imaging your experimental and control conditions to different "
"days if this can be in any way avoided. Fluorophores can become dimmer "
"over time in samples, which complicates interpretation if different "
"sample types were imaged on different days."
